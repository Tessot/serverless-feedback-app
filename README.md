# AWS Serverless Feedback App

**Status**: _Completed. Please create issues or pull requests if you have ideas for improvement._

The **Serverless Feedback App** is a simple two page web application that was developed to provide a mechanism for employees to provide feedback to their managers. Given the COVID-19 global pandemic and with remote working becoming the norm, managers are keen to get feedback from their direct reports to be able to act on them and ensure issues are addressed and employess engaged. There are so many ways of building an app like this on AWS so the key aim is to showcase how some of the AWS serverless services have been used to develop the app which hopefully will help educate or provide guidance on how to use these services for developing other use cases.

**This sample is not meant to be used as production as-is, but as an inspiration on how to leverage serverless services to build a simple application.**

_Please note that you may incure AWS charges for deploying the feedback application into your AWS account as not all services used are part of the [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) and you might exceed the free tier usage limit. To track costs in your AWS account, consider using [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) and [AWS Billing and Cost Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html). You can also set up a [budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/) to get notified of when actual or forecasted cost and usage exceed your budget threshold._
